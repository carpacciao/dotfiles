# Keyboard

I have a custom layout. Made from the belgian layout, not the one from mac but, the one from windows/linux.

## Keyboard Mac settings

I prefer having CTRL doing CMD instead of the WINDOW key.

```
System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Modification Keys -> select the keyboard -> invert control and command
```


##Â Build the layout

- Open the file with Ukelele and go to: file -> export installer disk image
- open the dmg and open the installer
- drop the bundle on it and install for all user
- reboot session
- go to keyboard layout, add (+) the new layout
- switch on the toolbar
